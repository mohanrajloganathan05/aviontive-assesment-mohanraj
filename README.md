## Simple Task Manager - React Skill Assessment:

This project is a Simple Task Manager Application developed as part of the React Intern Skill Assessment for the Aviontive by Mohanraj.


The main goal of this application is to demonstrate my understanding of **core React fundamentals** using a simple and clean approach, without external state management libraries or UI frameworks.



**The application allows users to:**

1.Add new tasks

2.View all tasks

3.Mark tasks as completed

4.Delete tasks 

5.Persist task data using browser local storage


## React Concepts Used:

- Functional Components
- useState for state management
- useEffect for handling side effect
- React Router (react-router-dom) for navigation
- Props and component-based architecture
- inputs in forms
- Conditional rendering
- Basic event handling
- Local Storage for data persistence



## Application Structure
The application consists of **three main pages**:

1. **Home Page**
   - Displays a welcome message
   - Shows the list of tasks
   - Allows marking tasks as completed or deleting them

2. **Add Task Page**
   - Contains a form to add a new task
   

3. **Summary Page**
   - Displays completed and pending tasks separately
