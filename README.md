##Simple Task Manager – React Skill Assessment

This project is a Simple Task Manager Application developed as part of the React Intern Skill Assessment for the Aviontive by Mohanraj.


The main goal of this application is to demonstrate my understanding of **core React fundamentals** using a simple and clean approach, without external state management libraries or UI frameworks.



The application allows users to:
1.Add new tasks
2.View all tasks
3.Mark tasks as completed
4.Delete tasks 
5.Persist task data using browser local storage


## React Concepts Used:

Functional Components
- useState for state management
- useEffect for handling side effect
- React Router (react-router-dom) for         navigation
- Props and component-based architecture
- inputs in forms
- Conditional rendering
- Basic event handling
- Local Storage for data persistence



## Application Structure
The application consists of **three main pages**:

1. **Home Page**
   1.Displays a welcome message
   2.Shows the list of tasks
   3.Allows marking tasks as completed or deleting them

2. **Add Task Page**
   1.Contains a form to add a new task
   2.Uses controlled input fields

3. **Summary Page**
   1.Displays completed and pending tasks separately
